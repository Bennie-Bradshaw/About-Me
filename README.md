# About Me:
I am currently a music producer / artist, partially experimental if I may add.
You can find my audible projects here:

I have various hobbies:

I enjoy scripting (Programming) and working on numerous projects, either for fun or just
to have something to do in my free time.

Music is my main hobby as of the moment.

I have done Black Smithing, Wood Work, Wood Turning, and logging as hobbies.

Traditional Archery is another hobby I have. I own a recurve bow. I used to participate in
a Tradition S3DA archery team several years ago and have participated in a handful of tournaments.

I am currently working on my Bachelors in Business Management of Information Systems.

I have always loved business as an overall topic and subject, I as well - always enjoyed
working on technology, either the hardware itself or the software. Though... that will 
not change the fact that cable management is a nightmare of it's own!
